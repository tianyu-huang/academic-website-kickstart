I am an applied scientist at AWS NeuroSymbolic AI, a team within the company's agentic AI organizaiton. Prior to joining AWS, I worked for Amazon Alexa on natural language understanding applications. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), focusing on data-driven design automation and uncertainty quantification with vehicle applications. I also finished two Master of Science degrees in [Statistics](https://statistics.northwestern.edu/) and Mechanical Engineering.

Before starting graduate school, I earned a B.Sc degree in Materials Science and Engineering and a B.A. in Journalism and Communications, both from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Shanghai, China.
